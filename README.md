# Moving-Target-Defense-RHM-using-SDN

# "Developed a Moving Target Defense mechanism to prevent IP scanning from inside & outside the network. 
# Controlled the packet flow in a SDN based on Random host mutation technique. 
# Developed the entire controller code including multithreading, decorators, event creation & event handling. 
# Performed extensive testing and evaluation.
# Hands on OpenFlow protocol & RYU controller development using python."

In this project, the network assets are hidden from the external and internal attackers. The OpenFlow Controller is programmed smartly to perform the IP Mutation technique. This technique changes the Real IP Addresses of the underlying hosts by assigning them a Virtual IP address at a high mutation rate. The Virtual IPs are extracted from the pool of unassigned IP addresses generated using pseudo random number generator ensuring high unpredictability.

Developed an self learning algorithm to attain automation.
